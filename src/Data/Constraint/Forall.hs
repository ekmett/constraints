{- The basic trick of this module is to use "skolem" types as test candidates
 - for whether a class predicate holds, and if so assume that it holds for all
 - types, unsafely coercing the typeclass dictionary.
 -
 - A previous version of this module used concrete, unexported types as the
 - skolems. This turned out to be unsound in the presence of type families.
 - There were 3 somewhat distinct issues:
 -
 - 1. Using closed type families, it is possible to test whether two concrete
 - types are equal, even if one of them is not directly importable.
 -
 - 2. Using just open type families, it is possible to test "at least 2 of
 - these n+1 types are equal", thus using the pigeonhole principle to thwart
 - any scheme based on having only a finite number of shared skolem types.
 -
 - 3. Using just pattern matching of types by unification, it is possible
 - to extract the skolem types from the application the `Forall p` expands
 - to. (Although type families are probably still needed to exploit this.)
 -
 - András Kovács and Ørjan Johansen independently realized that skolems
 - themselves made as type family applications can be used to solve the first
 - two problems (and discovered the third problem in the process). As a bonus,
 - the resulting code is easy to make polykinded.
 -
 - Problem 1 is solved by making the type family have no instances, forcing
 - GHC to make no assumption about what type a skolem is.
 -
 - Problem 2 is solved by parametrizing the skolem on the predicate tested
 - for. (This is a known trick in predicate logic.)
 -
 - Problem 3 is solved by making the `Forall p` application expand to a type
 - class, and have the *actual* test constraint be a superclass constraint on
 - that type class, thus preventing the user directly accessing it.
 -
 - An unfortunate side effect of the new method is that it tends to trigger
 - spurious errors from GHC test for cycles in superclass constraints. András
 - Kovács discovered that these can be silenced by yet another use of a type
 - family.
 -
 - David Feuer points out a remaining doubt about the soundness of this scheme:
 - GHC *does* know that the skolems created from a single predicate `p` are
 - equal. This could in theory apply even if the skolems come from two
 - *distinct* invocations of `Forall p`.
 -
 - However, we don't know any way of bringing two such skolems in contact with
 - each other to create an actual exploit. It would seem to require `p` to
 - already contain its own skolem, despite there being (hopefully) no way to
 - extract it from `Forall p` in order to tie the knot.

-- the `Skolem*` type families represent skolem variables, do not export!
-- if GHC supports it, these might be made closed with no instances.
